# CO2 dataset -------------------------------------------------------------

## DATA DESCRIPTION 

# The CO2 dataset in R records how grass plants from two origins, Quebec and
# Mississippi, respond to varying CO₂ concentrations and temperature treatments.

head(CO2)

# Each plant is identified by the `Plant` factor, with `Type` indicating its origin
# and `Treatment` showing whether it was chilled or nonchilled. `conc` gives the
# ambient CO₂ concentration (mL/L), and `uptake` measures the rate of CO₂
# assimilation (µmol/m²/sec).

# CO2 dataframe is a base dataframe. Convert this to a class `tibble`
# then assign to `df_co2`

# Q5
# Based on the models fitted in Q4 for Quebec and Mississippi plants,
# describe how CO2 assimilation rate responded to ambient CO2
# concentration under different treatments (chilled vs non-chilled) 
# for each plant origin. Highlight the differences between Quebec and 
# Mississippi plants, and use the model results to support your answers.

# ENTER YOUR ANSWER HERE as COMMENT:
# #For both Quebec and Mississippi plants, CO2 assimilation rate (uptake) increased with rising ambient CO2 concentration. 
#This reflects a general positive physiological response to higher CO2 availability.
#However, the strength of this response and the influence of treatment (chilled vs non chilled) 
#differed between plant origins.

# In the Quebec model, both concentration (conc) and treatment had clear effects. 
#Non chilled Quebec plants showed a stronger increase in CO2 uptake with increasing CO2 concentration,
#indicated by a steeper slope.
#Chilled plants had lower overall uptake, and their response curve increased more slowly. 
#chilling reduced both the baseline assimilation rate and the sensitivity to increasing CO2.
# For Mississippi plants, the main effect of concentration was also positive, but the treatment effect and
#the conc:treatment interaction were weaker than those observed in Quebec plants. 
#Non-chilled Mississippi plants typically had 
# higher uptake overall, but chilled plants did not show as large a reduction 
# in either baseline uptake or slope as the Quebec chilled plants did. This 
# suggests that Mississippi plants were less sensitive to chilling, and their 
# CO2-response curves remained more similar across treatments.

#Differences Between Origins
#Quebec plants demonstrated a stronger treatment effect: 
#chilling had a more pronounced negative effect on both the level of CO2 assimilation and 
#the rate at which uptake increased with rising CO2 concentration. Mississippi 
# plants showed a more stable response, with less change in slope and baseline uptake across treatments.

# BCI dataset:
# The BCI dataset contains tree species abundance data from 50 1-hectare plots 
# on Barro Colorado Island (Panama). Each row represents a plot, and each 
# column represents a tree species. Entries are counts of individuals of each 
# species in that plot. This dataset is often used to study species richness, 
# community composition, and diversity patterns in tropical forests.

# Originally, each plot was a row and each species a column.

# the corresponding count. This long format is easier to use for analysis

# BCI.env dataset:
# This dataset contains environmental variables for the 50 plots in the BCI dataset.
# Key columns include:
# - UTM.EW, UTM.NS: spatial coordinates of each plot
# - Precipitation: mean annual rainfall (mm)
# - Elevation: plot elevation (m)
# - Age.cat: categorical forest age class
# - Geology: underlying geological formation type
# - Habitat: dominant habitat type in the plot
# - Stream: indicates presence of streamside (riparian) habitat
# - EnvHet: environmental heterogeneity (Simpson diversity of habitat subcells)
# These variables help explain variation in species composition and abundance 
# across plots and allow exploration of species–environment relationships.
